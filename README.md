# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview 
Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.
1. Make a copy of your Mission_to_Mars.ipynb file, and rename it Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb.

2.Download the Mission_to_Mars_Challenge_starter_code.ipynb, copy the starter code, and paste at the end of your Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb file.

3.In Step 1, use your browser to visit the Mars Hemispheres website to view the hemisphere images.

4. Use the DevTools to inspect the page for the proper elements to scrape. You will need to retrieve the full-resolution image for each of Mars's hemispheres.
